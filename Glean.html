        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Glean was inspired by my own need for a way to organize the things I do. I was always finding myself with a to-do list that was too long and overwhelming. I wanted an app that would help me to prioritize my tasks and track my progress.

            I also wanted an app that was easy to use and didn't have a lot of bells and whistles. I wanted something that I could quickly open and add a task to, without having to spend a lot of time learning how to use it.
            
            Glean is the result of my desire to create a simple and effective to-do app that would help people to get things done. I hope you find it helpful! <a class="git" href="https://github.com/AngelOghenefuafo/MY-TO-DO-APP">Source code</a></p>
